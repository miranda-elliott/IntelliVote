Bernie Sanders,img_bs.jpg,You agree with this candidate on issues of Abortion |Gun Control | Marriage Equality  |Renewable Energy and Universal Healthcare,Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. In 2006 he was elected to the U.S. Senate after 16 years as Vermont’s sole congressman in the House of Representatives. Bernie is now serving his second term in the U.S. Senate after winning re-election in 2012 with 71 percent of the vote.,100,TRUE,TRUE,Pro-Abortion - Click to Read More, We are not going back. Not only are we not going to retreat on women's rights we are going to expand them. We are going forward not backward. We are not returning to the days of back-room abortions when countless women died or were maimed. The decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman her family and physician to make not the government.,TRUE,Pro-Gun Control -Click to Read More,Sample,TRUE,Pro-Marriage Equality -Click to Read More,Today the Supreme Court fulfilled the words engraved upon its building: ‘Equal justice under law.’ This decision is a victory for same-sex couples across our country as well as all those seeking to live in a nation where every citizen is afforded equal rights. For far too long our justice system has marginalized the gay community and I am very glad the Court has finally caught up to the American people.,TRUE,Pro-Renewable Energy - Click to Read More,The leaders of the seven major industrialized nations agreed in the summer of 2015 to a long-term goal of phasing out fossil fuels entirely and moving to an economy powered entirely by clean energy sources like wind solar and geothermal. We're already transitioning to a clean energy economy – but scientists say we need to do it faster and we need to do it right...Scientists warn us if we continue burning fossil fuels we will experience cataclysmic change. That means we must leave the vast majority of global reserves of coal natural gas and oil in the ground...Bernie recently co-sponsored the Keep It in the Ground Act to ban future fossil fuel leases on our public lands. His legislation would keep over 90 percent of the potential carbon emissions from fossil fuels on our federal lands and waters underground forever.Bernie believes we must transition away from fossil fuel consumption to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.,TRUE,Pro-Universal Healthcare -Click to Read More,Today is a good day for millions of Americans who have pre-existing conditions who can no longer be rejected by insurance companies. It is a good day for families with children under 26 who can keep their children on their health insurance policies. It is a good day for women who can no longer be charged far higher premiums than men. It is a good day for 30 million uninsured Americans who will have access to healthcare. It is a good day for seniors who will continue to see their prescription drug costs go down as the so-called doughnut hole goes away. It is a good day for small businesses who simply cannot continue to afford the escalating costs of providing insurance for their employees. It is a good day for 20 million Americans who will soon be able to find access to community health centers...In my view  while the Affordable Care Act is an important step in the right direction and I am glad that the Supreme Court upheld it  we ultimately need to do better. If we are serious about providing high-quality  affordable healthcare as a right  not a privilege  the real solution to America's health care crisis is a Medicare-for-all  single-payer system. Until then  we will remain the only major nation that does not provide health care for every man  woman and child as a right of citizenship
Hillary Clinton,img_hc.jpg,You agree with this candidate on issues of Abortion |Gun Control | Marriage Equality  |Renewable Energy and Universal Healthcare,Hillary Clinton has served as secretary of state senator from New York first lady of the United States first lady of Arkansas a practicing lawyer and law professor activist and volunteer—but the first thing her friends and family will tell you is that she’s never forgotten where she came from or who she’s been fighting for.  ,100,TRUE,TRUE,Pro-Abortion - Click to Read More,I believe we need to protect access to safe and legal abortion not just in principle but in practice. Any right that requires you to take extraordinary measures to access it is no right at all. Not when patients and providers have to endure harassment and intimidation just to walk in to a health center. Not when not when making an appointment means taking time off from work finding child care and driving halfway across your state. Not when providers are required by state law to recite misleading information to women in order to shame and scare them. And not as long as we have laws on the book like the Hyde Amendment making it harder for low-income women to exercise their full rights.,TRUE,Pro-Gun Control -Click to Read More,We can have common sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable while respecting responsible gun owners... The stakes are too high the costs are too dear and I am not and will not be afraid to keep fighting for common sense reforms and along with you achieve those on behalf of all who have been lost because of this senseless gun violence in this country.,TRUE,Pro-Marriage Equality -Click to Read More,Along with millions of Americans I am celebrating today's landmark victory for marriage equality and the generations of advocates and activists who fought to make it possible...This ruling is an affirmation of the commitment of couples across the country who love one another. It reflects the will of the vast and growing multitude of Americans who believe that LGBT couples deserve to be recognized under the law and treated equally in the eyes of society. And it represents our country at its best: inclusive open and striving towards true equality.,TRUE,Pro-Renewable Energy - Click to Read More,I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil but principally coal to where we need to be which is clean renewable energy and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas. And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal building coal plants all the time also to get out from under especially if they were in Europe the pressure from Russia which has been incredibly intense. So we did say natural gas is a bridge. We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible because in order to deal with climate change we have got to move as rapidly as we can. That's why I've set big goals. I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years,TRUE,Pro-Universal Healthcare -Click to Read More,I applaud the Supreme Court's decision to affirm what the authors of the Affordable Care Act [Obamacare] clearly intended and wrote into law: that health insurance should be affordable and available in every state across the country...The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect but the evidence is clear: it's working. Sixteen million Americans have gained coverage. Millions of young people are able to stay on their parents' plans. Insurance companies can no longer discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or charge women higher rates just because of their gender. Republicans should stop trying to tear down the law and start working across party lines to build on these successes. I've fought for the promise of quality affordable health care for every American for decades. And I'm not going to stop now. Anyone seeking to lead our country should stand up and support this decision."
John Kasich,img_jk.jpg,You disagree with this candidate on issues of Abortion |Gun Control | Marriage Equality  |Renewable Energy and Universal Healthcare,18 years of national security experience. As a member of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee John Kasich was a key supporter of President Ronald Reagan’s national security policies and played a role in every major national security effort that helped end the Cold War. He then went to work helping transform our military into a flexible force able to respond to more varied threats like those we face today. The world is more dangerous now than ever before. On-the-job training just won’t work. John Kasich doesn’t need to “read-up” on national security or foreign policy but will hit the ground running as Commander in Chief on Day One. America needs John Kasich’s experienced steady hand to reinvigorate our military strengthen our alliances and start defending ourselves against those who seek to destroy freedom and harm Americans.,0,FALSE,FALSE,Con-Abortion - Click to Read More,There are restrictions that we put in we've done a lot of things in Ohio effecting abortions after 20 weeks but until that law [Roe v.

Everybody has the right to keep and bear arms to either protect your family protect yourselves to be a hunter. The 2nd amendment is part of that Constitution. It's something I believe in.

But let me tell you also what we're trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power. And you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy wind energy efficiency renewables matter."    ,FALSE,Con-Universal Healthcare -Click to Read More,"I don't support Obamacare; I want to repeal it...

Donald Trump,img_dt.jpg,You disagree with this candidate on issues of Abortion |Gun Control | Marriage Equality  |Renewable Energy and Universal Healthcare,Donald J. Trump is the very definition of the American success story continually setting the standards of excellence while expanding his interests in real estate sports and entertainment. He is the archetypal businessman – a deal maker without peer. Mr. Trump started his business career in an office he shared with his father in Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn New York. He worked with his father for five years where they were busy making deals together. Mr. Trump has been quoted as saying "My father was my mentor and I learned a tremendous amount about every aspect of the construction industry from him." Likewise Fred C. Trump often stated that "some of my best deals were made by my son Donald...everything he touches seems to turn to gold." Mr. Trump then entered the very different world of Manhattan real estate. In New York City and around the world the Trump signature is synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses.  Among them are the world-renowned Fifth Avenue skyscraper Trump Tower and the luxury residential buildings Trump Parc Trump Palace Trump Plaza 610 Park Avenue The Trump World Tower (the tallest building on the East Side of Manhattan) and Trump Park Avenue.  Mr. Trump was also responsible for the designation and construction of the Jacob Javits Convention Center on land controlled by him known as the West 34th Street Railroad Yards and the total exterior restoration of the Grand Central Terminal as part of his conversion of the neighboring Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The development is considered one of the most successful restorations in the City and earned Mr. Trump an award from Manhattan's Community Board Five for the "tasteful and creative recycling of a distinguished hotel." Over the years Mr. Trump has owned and sold many great buildings in New York including the Plaza Hotel (which he renovated and brought back to its original grandeur as heralded by the New York Times Magazine) the St. Moritz Hotel (three times and now called the Ritz Carlton on Central Park South) and until 2002 the land under the Empire State Building (which allowed the land and lease to be merged together for the first time in over 50 years).,0,FALSE,FALSE,Con-Abortion - Click to Read More,"[Donald Trump:] I am pro-life. [Chris Matthews:] How do you ban abortion? How do you actually do it? [Trump:] Well You go back to a position like they had where people will perhaps go to illegal places but you have to ban it… [Matthews:] Do you believe in punishment for abortion yes or no as a principle? [Trump:] The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment. [Matthews:] For the woman? [Trump:] Yeah. There has to be some form."    ,FALSE,Con-Gun Control -Click to Read More,"[Moderator Maria Bartiromo] Mr. Trump are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America? TRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now. If even in Paris if they had guns on the other side going in the opposite direction you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no…",FALSE,Con-Marriage Equality -Click to Read More,"The court has ruled very strongly. And you know I would have preferred the court let the states make the decision but the courts have ruled. And probably most people seem to think that's not going to be overturned or changed by Congress. It doesn't sound like anybody has the votes or the stomach for it. But I would have preferred having the states make the decision.",FALSE,Con-Renewable Energy - Click to Read More,There has been a big push to develop alternative forms of energy--so-called green energy--from renewable sources. That's a big mistake. To begin with the whole push for renewable energy is being driven by the wrong motivation the mistaken belief that global climate change is being caused by carbon emissions. If you don't buy that--and I don't--then what we have is really just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.The most popular source of green energy is solar panels. They work but they don't make economic sense. They don't provide enough energy savings to cover the cost of installing and using them. They are the most highly subsidized for of green energy in America. Some estimates claim it takes as long as several decades after installing solar panels to get your money back. That's not exactly what I would call a sound investment,FALSE,Con-Universal Healthcare -Click to Read More,"As far as Obamacare is concerned... it's a disaster. It is really kicking in... in 16. It is going to be a tremendous negative for the country. And here's the problem it's terrible the rates are going up through the roof. You look at every aspect of Obamacare it's just not working. And there are a lot of people that still don't have insurance. But the people that had good insurance now have bad insurance. Their deductibles are through the roof. Their rates are through the roof. And I hear more and more complaints. Another thing that nobody talks about... is doctors. I know so many doctors that are going to retire they don't want to do it. One of my friends whose a doctor said you know I have more accountants than I have nurses because of the complexity of it. So it really does have to be changed... And ideally repealed and replaced... I want healthcare for everyone... You can't let the people in this country that are poor people the people without the money without the resources go without healthcare. I just can't even imagine that you're sick and you can't even go to a doctor."
Ted Cruz ,img_tc.jpg,You disagree with this candidate on issues of Abortion |Gun Control | Marriage Equality  |Renewable Energy and Universal Healthcare,As Solicitor General for the State of Texas and in private practice Ted authored more than 80 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and argued 43 oral arguments including nine before the U.S. Supreme Court and has won an unprecedented series of landmark national victories including defending U.S. sovereignty against the UN and the World Court in Medellin v. Texas defending our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms defending the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol and the words “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance. In the U.S. Senate Ted has led the fight to repeal Obamacare to stop President Obama’s illegal and unconstitutional executive amnesty and to defend life marriage the First Amendment the Second Amendment and our entire Bill of Rights. And most important he’s kept his promise to speak the truth and do what he said he’d do. Ted has proven to be the exact type of courageous conservative we need to reignite the promise of America restore our Constitution and defend the values we all hold dear.,0,FALSE,FALSE,Con-Abortion - Click to Read More,"Today marks the dark anniversary of Roe v.

Since that 1973 ruling more than 55 million lives have been lost to abortion.Defending life at its core includes protecting both the unborn child and his or her mother from an irreversible injustice…I have been honored to defend the dignity of human life helping successfully defend the federal Partial Birth Abortion Act state parental notification laws and Texas's law prohibiting state funds for groups that provide abortions.No right is more precious and fundamental than the right to life and any just society should protect that right at every stage from conception to natural death.",FALSE,Con-Gun Control -Click to Read More,Washington politicians shouldn't be taking advantage of recent tragedy to try to push an aggressive gun control agenda. Real assault weapons--machine guns--are already functionally illegal and they have been since 1934. This proposal would have done nothing to prevent the terrible murders in Newtown but it would limit the constitutional liberties of law-abiding citizens. And gun control doesn’t work – the empirical data overwhelmingly demonstrate that strict gun-control laws consistently produce more crime and more murders. The Second Amendment exists to ensure that law-abiding Americans can protect their homes and families and I look forward to helping lead the fight to defeat this bill and to protect our constitutional right to keep and bear arms.,FALSE,Con-Marriage Equality -Click to Read More,Today the Court doubled down with a 5-4 opinion that undermines not just the definition of marriage but the very foundations of our representative form of government...That is unacceptable. On the substantive front I have already introduced a constitutional amendment to preserve the authority of elected state legislatures to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman and also legislation stripping the federal courts of jurisdiction over legal assaults on marriage...By redefining the meaning of common words and redesigning the most basic human institutions this Court has crossed from the realm of activism into the arena of oligarchy...The decisions that have deformed our constitutional order and have debased our culture are but symptoms of the disease of liberal judicial activism that has infected our judiciary. A remedy is needed that will restore health to the sick man in our constitutional system.,FALSE,Con-Renewable Energy - Click to Read More,When it comes to energy I think we should pursue all of the above. America is blessed with abundant energy sources and we ought to pursue everything. We ought to pursue oil and gas and coal nuclear wind and solar and biofuel and ethanol. All across the board we ought to use the tremendous resources we have. You look at what this administration has done it has waged a war on energy. It’s waged a war on oil and gas and it has waged a war on coal something fierce.,FALSE,Con-Universal Healthcare -Click to Read More,"I have made repeal of this disastrous law [Affordable Care Act] a top priority since the first day I arrived in the Senate and have made its repeal central to my campaign. Any candidate not willing to do the same--and campaign on it every day--should step aside… After today's ruling Obamacare will now be responsible for imposing illegal taxes on more than 11 million individuals and for burdening hundreds of thousands of businesses with illegal penalties on their workers killing jobs and further slowing economic growth. President Obama's health care law remains deeply unpopular and is harming countless Americans by increasing costs and worsening the quality of care. I remain fully committed to the repeal of Obamacare--every single word of it. And in 2017 we will do exactly that."
